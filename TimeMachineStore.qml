// twice. This file is the model; Panel.qml and RestoreBrowser.qml are views.

// The rule this store is built around: showing "3 hours ago" must never cost a
// password, a network round trip, or a wait on a sleeping NAS. `status --json`
// reads nothing but local files, so the idle poll is free. Everything that
// does touch the repository -- snapshots, ls, restore -- runs only in response
